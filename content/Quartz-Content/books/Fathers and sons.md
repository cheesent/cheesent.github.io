### First 3 chapters
It describes the life of a russian family, the father being Nikolai Petrovitch and the son Arkady, with his friend Bazarov that came with him to his Farm to stay. Piotr is the servant.

This is an encounter after a while, because Arkady was on school, and the father tells that now he has another woman on the house.

### chapter 4
Bazarov was not really welcome, more than anything because of Pavel not liking him

### Chapter 5
It is revealed that Fenitchka had a son with Nikolai, and Arkasha did want to know his brother but Fenitchka still just appeared for a moment to serve cocoa.

### chapter 6
Starts with bazarov returning to the tea gathering after he had captured some frogs for experimentation as he is a doctor.

The uncle ends confrontating bazarov as this last did irritate him with all that nihilist stuff and what not, at the end Nikolai intervenes and they go for a walk, and in the next chapter Arkady tells the story of the uncle, he says that even if his uncle is an aristocrat Bazarov should consider him, so to not be rude to him.

### chapter 7

Pavel got roaested by Bazaraov in the story Arkady told him, his story is more of a solitary man after he failed to get the love of his life.

## Chapter 8

Pavel Met the son of Fenitchka, he was kinda weird I guess and later nikolai appeared and then pavel retired from there.

### Chapter 9

Bazarov and Arkady have a conversation about his new brother and the place they are living.

### Chapter 10

Confrontation! 
It started with the young lads discussing having their opinions and Nikolai heard and told Pavel, pavel was furious disgusted with Pavel and they had a large discussion and in the end Nikolai mentioned that perhaps its the same for the generation change, as once he did similar with his mother and told her that she couldn't understan him because they were of different generations.

### 11
Nikolai was left sad wandering outside, Pavel didn't the same but he had some of the same Feeling. Bazarov now planned to go to the dinner with Arkady with some parent of them they heard when they were discussing. (Matvei Illitch)

Nikolai and Pavel felt relieved they were going now, Bazarov to visit his parents and no clear plans on returning. The servants were sad and didnt want Bazarov to go.


### 12
Bazarov encountered his old disciple **SÃ­tnikov** and then he said they were going to the house of the lady **Kukshina**

### 13
Sitnikov (victor) knew kukshina very well they had 4 bottles of champaing and they were having a good time, not so much with Bazarov and Arkady.

### 14
In the governors party Arkady had a great time talking to a lady. Odintsova, on the other side Kukshina didn't get attention from the boys except for victor.

Arkady was upset with the comments Bazarov made about womans, when he said that when womans have freedom of thinking they are most probably monsters.

### 15
Thw boys met Anna Odintsove in the hotel she was staying, Bazarov was impressed with the lady, she liked Arakady but only on the sense of a young beother. They both said she was magnificent, also mentioning her body.


### 16-17

Both were staying at Anna's house, Arkady knew he had no chance with her but still found pleasent his encounters with her sister Katia that played the piano. With bazarov the thing was different, he was starting to feel emotions toward her but the way he was and the things he was agains *the romanticism* was the thing making him unreasonable towards her even when after a long conversation she made quite clear that she wanted something with him.

### 18

A chapter for a more introspective review for our characters Bazarov and Anna, Anna in a way forced Bazarov to confess his love to her and the way he was feeling, but until now that didn't mean they would get along just because of that, we will see later on the next chapter.

### 19

I'm quite disappointed on Bazarov's beliefs and unflexiblity, because of his ideals he couldn't conceive the possibility of a woman having some sort of control over him even in a minimal way, also his opinions on women are at times rather sexist. 

On the other side, both friends decided to part from Anna's house to Bazarov fathers, Sitnikov appeared at the end on the house and he too decided he was going with them.

### 20

Parents of bazarov:
Vassilly Ivanovitch
Arina Vlasyevna


Nice long meeting with the parents of Bazarov, they showed the house and everything else, there's also other many secondary characters, and some descriptions and backstory of the parents of Bazarov.

Also with Bazarov, he was not really emotional, a bit bitter as the book describes, perhaps he feels alienated or smth.
